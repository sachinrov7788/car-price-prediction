## LIVE DEMO : [Heruko App](https://breast-cancer-11.herokuapp.com/)

## Tech Stack

 - Gunicorn Server
 - Heroku (PaaS)

## Model Training
  I have added a detailed notes on the training and inference model in this [repository](https://github.com/sachin778899/Salary-Price-Prediction).
> In this repo, I will only have instructions to build front end and deploy.


## Instruction
#### To run locally,
1. Clone this repository with ```git clone```.
2. Open a terminal inside the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Run python app.py to open the app on ```localhost:8000```.

#### To Deploy on Heroku,

> Make sure you have all the requirements in requirements.py

```I assume you have already created heroku account and Heroku CLI on your machine```.

1. Open a terminal on the project directory and create a heroku application.
2. And deploye the project in that Heroku application.
3. Then it will generate link on Heroku application.

Now you are all set to go, deploy with a single command ```git push heroku master```.
